    "In astronomy (and most sciences) we typically have to deal with quantities which have some dimension (i.e. unit). The quantity is completely represented by not only a number but also a unit to go along with it. When we consider the same quantity in a different unit system, the quantity itself will not change, although the number used to represent it does change. While solving involved problems with several dimensional quantities, it may become cumbersome to keep track of the quantity if our program stores it as a single number with implied units. Astropy units library is a useful way to keep track of a dimensional quantity "

Several filter systems are in use, and the filters used for a certain observation are usually specified along with the observation data. Here, we will take up a specific filter system, SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). In general the analysis of any other filter system will also be similar. In this exercise, we will model a star as a perfect blackbody and try to find the intensity detected in each filter.\n",
