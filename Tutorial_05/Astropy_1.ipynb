    "# Astropy I: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have looked at some interesting features that Python and some of its packages have to offer. We had a glimpse of the power of NumPy and Matplotlib. These are perhaps very versatile packages and find use at a lot of places. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the scope for astronomical data analysis is very vast and is only getting wider with time. Since Python is the  primary programming language that many astronomers prefer, some went on to make packages relevant to astronomy. What if all such packages could be found together under one umbrella? Well, the **Astropy Project** is the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is an open-source and community-developed Python package, with the first public version released in [2013](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/10/aa22068-13/aa22068-13.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Astropy is to provide core astronomy-related functionality to the community, including support for domain-specific file formats such as flexible image transport system (FITS) files, common ASCII table formats, unit and physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to astronomy, celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS) support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions.\n",

    "## Introduction to FITS files\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular file format used in astronomy, Flexible Image Transport System ([FITS](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_documentation.html)), is a digital file format meant for storage of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays (2D for the example we'll look at), or tables. Astropy provides the `astropy.io.fits` package to deal with FITS files efficiently and access information with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "FITS files can also be used to store non-image data like (and this is foreshadowing) light curves or spectra in a table format. This particular application, we will see in the Scipy II tutorial. For the time being, we will concern ourselves only with image data.\n",

The dimensions of this camera are 4108x4096, indicating the number of individual pixels that collect data i.e. photons. CCDs are particularly popular because of their linear response to light, meaning that the reading of each pixel is essentially linearly proportional to the number of photons falling on this pixel. Hence, the array of numbers that is stored in a FITS file is basically a map of how many photons are incident on each pixel. \n",
