***

## [Tutorial 1 : Basics of Python](./Tutorial_01)

* Basic syntax, and syntax for loops, conditional statements, and opening simple files, (lists, tuples and dictionaries)
* Parse a file and make a list containing the number of moons for each planet.

***

## [Tutorial 2 : Introduction to NumPy](./Tutorial_02)

* Numpy arrays, indexing, slicing.
* Parse file as above using numpy (np.where, for example).
* Beehive Cluster.

***

## [Tutorial 3 : Functions in Python](./Tutorial_03)

* Defining functions.
* Hubble Law, Number density of galaxies.

***

## [Tutorial 4 : Introduction to Matplotlib (Matplotlib I)](./Tutorial_04)

* Simple Plotting. Labels, colors, title, grid
* GW astronomy

***

## [Tutorial 5 : Introduction to Astropy and FITS format (Astropy I)](./Tutorial_05)

* Using Astropy.io to import datafiles, astropy.table.
* Take the data from a harder to parse data file.
* Introduction to fits files.

***

## [Tutorial 6 : Web Scraping](./Tutorial_06)

* Scrape web for some data (try to do this for constellations)
* Make an image of the constellation using RA, Dec or Mars in retrograde (simple scatter plot)

***

## [Tutorial 7 : Curve Fitting (SciPy I)](./Tutorial_07)

* Curve fitting
* Scrape data from Cepheids, and plot Period-Luminosity relation
* Frequency vs time inspiral

***

## [Tutorial 8 : Image Reduction](./Tutorial_08)

* Reducing an image of a popular target. (And further processing)

***

## [Tutorial 9 : Advanced Plotting (Matplotlib II)](./Tutorial_09)

* Subplots, and Using Object Oriented approach
* Make several HR diagrams, say, with different filters.
* Compare features, and observe that UV filters are good at filtering multiple stellar populations.

***

## [Tutorial 10 : Astropy Quantities (Astropy II)](./Tutorial_10)

* Using astropy quantities, make a black body spectra.
* Using filters (SDSS), find the instrumental magnitude of a star in different bands.
* Have a function which returns these values, given the temperature of a star.

***

## [Tutorial 11 : Classes in Python](./Tutorial_11)

* Make a class for a star and a filter.
