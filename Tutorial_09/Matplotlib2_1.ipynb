    "\n",

A very good place to find stars of different ages together, is star clusters and particularly globular clusters as they tend to be quite old and hence contain stars in almost every stage. So we take all the stars in the cluster, and plot their HR diagram.\n",

    "Now in the diagram itself, temperature is plotted on the x-axis, but in reverse, i.e, temperature decreases on moving away from origin on the x axis, while luminosity is plotted on the y axis as usual. But instead of plotting temperature, we plot something called as '[color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_index)', which is the difference between the magnitudes of the star directly observed in different wavelength bands. This color turns out to increase as temperature decreases. Similarly for the luminosity, we plot the magnitude in a given wavelength band, and as we have seen before, higher the luminosity, lower the magnitude.\n"
